This is a simple program created to encode or decode a message using the Vigenere cipher. 

The Cipher:
In the Vigenere cipher, rather than shifting the entire alphabet over by a constant amount
(which is relatively easy to crack), a keyword/phrase is used to establish a pattern by 
which the message will be encoded.

The Program:
The user can either choose to encode a message by providing the original message and
the keyword. The user can also choose to decode a message by providing the encrypted
message and keyword.
